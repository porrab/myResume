        I am a 3rd-year Information Technology student (KMUTT) interest in
        Frontend Development. Most of my experience comes from hands-on projects
        such as Life Connect and IT Bangmod Mobile Shop, demonstrating skills in
        API integration and creating user-focused solutions. Seeking a Frontend
        Developer internship to contribute to a dynamic team and grow within an
