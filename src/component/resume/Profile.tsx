        I am a 3rd-year Information Technology student (KMUTT) passionate about
        Front-end Development. My experience is built upon hands-on projects such
        as 'Life Connect' and 'IT Bangmod Mobile Shop', which have provided me
        with practical skills in front-end technologies and API integration.
        Seeking a Front-end Developer internship to contribute to a dynamic team
        and grow within an Agile environment.
